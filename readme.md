The aim of this project was to detect if a vehicle is over-speeding and then to capture the image of the number plate of that Vehicle and then send an SMS on his/her mobile with an overspeeding ticket which has the time ,data and the name of the street where there overspeeding occurred.Since the vehicle is moving , we used various image segmentation techniques to get a clear image of the number plate. After obtaining the clean image then we compared the letters with a  pre-existing database using MATLAB to detect the characters on their number plate.
